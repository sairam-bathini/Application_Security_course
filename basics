1. What is Application Security?
An application is a program or software designed to perform specific tasks for users.

Examples:
   Mobile Apps: WhatsApp, Instagram.
   Desktop Software: Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop.
   Web Applications: Gmail, Amazon, YouTube.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Secure Applications?
Applications handle sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers).
If not secured, they can be hacked, leading to:
   Financial losses.
   Data breaches.
   Loss of trust.
Example:
Imagine a banking app. If a hacker exploits a security weakness, they could:
   Steal customer money.
   Access private data like account details.

Application Security ensures that the app is protected from such threats.

2. What is a Web Application?
Definition:
A web application is a program that runs on a web server and is accessed through a browser.

Common Examples:
  Online shopping platforms like Amazon.
  Social media sites like Facebook.
  Email services like Gmail.

Functions to Secure:

Authentication: Ensuring only legitimate users can log in.
Example: Logging into Gmail with a password and 2FA.

Data Storage: Protecting sensitive data like payment information.
Example: Credit card info on an e-commerce site.

Input Handling: Preventing harmful input.
Example: Preventing SQL Injection when entering usernames.

Session Management: Keeping sessions secure from hijacking.
Example: Securing a user’s session when shopping online.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Secure Web Applications?
Web applications are accessible globally, making them a prime target for hackers.

Example: If Amazon’s website is hacked, attackers could steal millions of users’ payment details.

3. What are Application Security Goals?
The primary goals of application security can be explained using the CIA Triad:

Confidentiality: Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
Integrity: Ensure data is accurate and hasn’t been altered.
Availability: Ensure the application is accessible when needed.

Example:
A ride-hailing app like Uber:
Confidentiality:
    Customer data (name, location, credit card) is encrypted.
Integrity:
    Ride prices and route information cannot be tampered with by hackers.
Availability:
    The app must be available during peak times without crashing.
